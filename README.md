TextRP is an innovative Unified Messaging System that is set to revolutionize utility on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). We fuse the power of the Matrix open standard and communication protocol with the XRPL, creating a powerful union of technologies that ushers in a new era of messaging capabilities.

Harnessing the Transformative Potential of DLT
We believe DLT is a transformative technology. By integrating with the XRPL, we unlock a world of possibilities for users. Your XRP wallet address becomes your gateway to the TextRP experience, serving as your default username and identifier. This integration ensures easy connectivity, seamless communication, and user privacy.

Uniqueness and Individuality
TextRP goes beyond traditional messaging platforms by incorporating NFT-enabled features. By owning specific NFTs, users can unlock messaging functionalities and gain access to exclusive privileges within the platform. Our platform-specific NFTs, known as "Feature Packs," allow users to select and utilize the features they want, giving them full control of their messaging experience.
 
Security and Privacy
Security is a top priority at TextRP. We prioritize user privacy by implementing the highest grade end-to-end encryption as the default standard. In-app messages can only be decrypted by participants in the conversation, ensuring complete confidentiality. We have also integrated a secure and seamless authentication process through XUMM wallet login, offering users a frictionless onboarding experience while safeguarding their data.

Effortless Communication
We understand the importance of bridging communication gaps between different platforms. TextRP enables users to communicate effortlessly across various channels, including SMS/MMS, Twitter DMs, Discord DMs, Slack, and more. Our platform unifies conversations from disparate inboxes into one, making communication a breeze and eliminating the need for fragmented conversations scattered across different apps.

Inclusivity and Connectivity
TextRP embraces inclusivity through its Ledger Relay Messaging feature. Users can send messages to any XRP address, regardless of whether the recipient has a TextRP account. For active TextRP users, the conversation continues within the app. If the recipient doesn't have a TextRP account, the message is stored, and a microtransaction is sent via the XRPL with a message notification in the memo field. 

NFT Integration and Partner Collaborations
TextRP's NFT Integration Subsystem allows integration of NFTs from other projects into our platform. By partnering with TextRP, Web3 projects can enhance the functionality of their NFTs, engage with their community, and leverage our messaging capabilities. Users' NFT holdings are verified upon login, unlocking specific features associated with partnered collections, such as branded sticker packs and custom themes. This integration provides added value, an immersive messaging experience, and new avenues for engagement and utility within the TextRP ecosystem.

Launch Packs and Community Engagement
To support the development and adoption of the TextRP messaging platform, we offer Launch Packs, a limited-edition collection of 5,000 founder-level NFTs. By holding at least one Launch Pack NFT, users gain exclusive benefits, including a Lifetime Subscription NFT, airdrops of new Feature Packs, and access to the Chat Rewards Program. Launch Packs not only provide access to premium features and benefits but also foster a sense of community and engagement among early adopters.

Feature Distribution
Feature Packs (FPs) are distributed to enhance the customization of the TextRP messaging experience. Holders of Launch Packs (LPs) benefit from the distribution model. When a new feature is developed, it undergoes testing by alpha-tester FP holders. Each LP holder receives an airdrop of one new FP for each LP held. The phased distribution of FPs occurs in biweekly waves, starting with Splendid Tier, Aurious Tier, Candidus Tier, and then all other LP holders. The final wave is the FP public sale. FPs are distributed based on the amount of LPs held per wallet on a 1:1 ratio. These FPs are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that can be freely traded by the holders. Public sale of FPs is delayed until Wave 5, allowing LP holders up to 60 days (depending on the Tier) to distribute extra FPs to the general public through preferred marketplaces or peer-to-peer trading.

Join the New Evolution of Utility
TextRP is committed to add a unique utility to the XRPL and revolutionize the messaging landscape. Through our integration with the XRPL, NFT-enabled features, robust security measures, and focus on seamless communication, we proudly present a messaging platform that empowers users to connect, communicate, and thrive. Join us on this exciting journey as we reshape the way people interact and communicate worldwide. Together, we will redefine the boundaries of digital connectivity and propel the XRPL into the hands of millions, fostering a new era of global communication and collaboration.
